# Project Report \(`tri`\)

## Project Overview

`tri` is a repository that combines a C\+\+ application with supporting JavaScript code/tools. The main focus is building and running the C\+\+ program in CLion on Windows, with utilities that help inspect generated output (e.g., a simple file viewer component).

## Repository Information

- Remote: `origin` \(`https://github.com/alpdik/tri.git`\)
